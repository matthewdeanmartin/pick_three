pick_three
----------
I read that people who:

1) Can't save money, for lack of self control
2) Don't have access to traditional banks

will play pick three as a sort of savings account. If you play every week, every so many years you will win. Now state Lotto isn't a fair game, so you slowly lose your total money. If the game was fair, i.e. had an expect value of $1 for every $1 played, then in the long run, no player would make or lose money, on average.

So if you were afraid you'd spend your savings on impulse purchase, you'd never be able to save up $1000 for buying a dishwasher. With pick 3, you'd see ~1000 plays of no wins and then you'd win a $1000, on average. In practice, time gaps would vary. How much?

Who's going to get all the money? Who's going to lose it all?

Will one player absorb all the money? I suspect in most versions of the game, if they go on long enough, someone will, either the house or a player. This sort of game is sometimes posited as a metaphor for capitalism, where wealth inequality gets worse over time.

How do you minimize the chance of one player or the house absorbing all the money?

With fixed prizes, how much money does the house need to ensure enough to meet all winnigs?

How would it work as a "savings account"?

How long do people have to play before everyone is probably even (put in the game about as much as they got out)?

If long term losses are a sort of "banking fee" 

What sort of game works best for a game among friends? What is the cheapest sort of house that a set of players could pay to allow for fixed prizes?

In a lifetime of playing, say a few decades of weekly playing, how much do players lose to the house? I would have guessed 100%, but it takes much longer. In human timespans, players can expect to lose about 20% when prizes are 1/2 their expected value.

Can you win? (Games variations where other player choices affect outcome)

So playing the state with fixed prizes can't be "won".

That said:

If the other players use a biased number generator, can you exploit that?

Money Laundering
---
Another creative use for lotteries is money laundering. Lets say you have $1000, bet it on state lotto and you could expect to win $500, in Maryland. You'd tell the policy that you bet a $1 and won $500. The tickets are sold anonymously, so it might be difficult for the authorities to realize you gambled $1000 to win $500.

Fancy Bets
---
What effect do fancy bets have on the game? Are all the bets the same?

Do rounding errors make certain bets slightly better? State lottos round prizes to nearest dollar, ten, or one hundred, put odds are usually odd-looking numbers.

The three-way and six-way box in Maryland suffers from rounding, so the expected value of those bets is worse than a straight bet.

Three and six way combox cost $3 and $6 for a 3 in 1000 and 6 in 1000 chance of winning. I suppose that you could construct an n in 1000 chance of winning $500 using combinations of straight, 3 way and 6 way boxes while minimizin the number of slips you have to fill out.

Parimutuel

In New Jersey, the pick 3 prize the prize revenue divided among the winners. So if everyone wasted their bet on 777 and only a single better won on 973, then that person would take all. So it seems that if there is an edge to gambling against non-random betters, it would be in Parimutuel games.
